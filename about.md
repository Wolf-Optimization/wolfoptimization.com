Wolf Optimization is dedicated to building high-performance optimization solvers for conic programs. It was originally build for solving large sparse conic optimization problems that were being formulated to solve stability problems in geotechnical engineering. These are often very large problems generated by refining a finite element mesh to reduce the gap between the lower and upper bound on the collapse load.
