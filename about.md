Wolf Optimization Pty Ltd is a small company dedicated to building high-performance optimization solvers for conic programs. It originated from solving large sparse conic optimization problems that were being formulated to solve stability problems in geotechnical engineering, where very large problems are generated by refining a finite element mesh to reduce the gap between the lower and upper bound on the collapse load.
